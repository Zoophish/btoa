Like most things, BtoA wasn't created in a vacuum. It was built from the ground up, but looked to a handful of other projects, including a previous Arnold for Blender effort and LuxCoreRender's Blender add-on, for help. Thank you to everyone who put time and effort into this project!

Special thanks to Simon Wendsche and the LuxCoreRender team. We based our implementation of BtoA's node system on the implementation in the LuxCoreRender Blender add-on.
